Feature: Lookup location by country and postal code

  @happy
  Scenario Outline: Successful lookup with valid country code and postal code
    Given the country code is "<countryCode>"
    And the postal code is "<postalCode>"
    When I send a GET request to the Zippopotam API
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the country name should be "Germany"
    And the place name should include "K√∂ln"
    And the state should include "Nordrhein-Westfalen"
    Examples:
      | countryCode | postalCode |
      | de          | 51149      |
      | DE          | 51149      |
